This is a Music Recommendation System that provides personalized song recommendations based on user-selected songs. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze song features and recommend similar songs to the user.

## Overview

The Music Recommendation System is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications, and various machine learning algorithms for recommendation purposes. It allows users to select a song from a dropdown menu and generates recommendations based on the selected song's features such as artists, album, and user ratings. The recommendations are dynamically generated using cosine similarity between song features.

## Features

- **User Interface**: The system provides a simple and intuitive user interface built using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the application easily.
- **Song Selection**: Users can select a song from a dropdown menu populated with available songs.
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: Recommendations are generated dynamically based on the selected song, providing real-time personalized suggestions.
- **Customization**: Users can further customize their recommendations based on their preferences by selecting different songs.
